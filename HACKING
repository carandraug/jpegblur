Hacking at jpegblur
===================


Build from development sources
------------------------------

If you're keen on using the development version, you need to run
`autogen.sh` to create the `configure` script.  You'll probably also
want to do an out of tree build.  The steps are then something like:

    cd ~/src/jpegblur
    ./autogen.sh
    cd ~/builds/jpegblur
    ~/src/jpegblur/configure
    make
    make install


Making a release
----------------

1. Update the version number in `configure.ac` and in the NEWS file
   and make a commit:

       VERSION="NEW-VERSION-NUMBER"
       git commit -m "maint: release $VERSION" configure.ac NEWS

2. Build a source distribution from a git archive export.  Performing
   a release from a git archive will ensure that the release will not
   accidentally include modified or untracked files:

       rm -rf target/
       git archive --format=tar --prefix="target/" HEAD | tar -x
       cd target/
       ./autogen.sh
       ./configure
       make dist
       make distcheck
       cd ..

3. Tag the commit used to build the distribution:

       git tag -a -m "Add tag release-$VERSION" release-$VERSION

4. Add the `+dev` to the version string in `configure.ac`, add an
   empty section for the next version in the `NEWS` file, and commit:

       git commit -m "maint: set version to $VERSION+dev after release-$VERSION" \
           configure.ac NEWS

5. Release the file `target/jpegblur-$VERSION.tar.gz`

6. Push the new commits and tags:

       git push upstream main
       git push upstream release-$VERSION
