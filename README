jpegblur - "lossless" "blurring" of regions in JPEG image
=========================================================

jpegblur is a program "heavily based on" (read 80% copied from)
jpegtran (jpegtran is a program distributed with libjpeg for lossless
transformation of JPEG files) to blur regions of a JPEG image while
minimising changes in the image file.

jpegblur takes bounding boxes from command line and returns a JPEG
image with those regions blurred.  It does this in DCT space thus
avoiding the introduction of new compression artefacts.  It also
preserves all metadata by copying all extra markers.

The purpose of this program is to redact Personally Identifiable
Information (PII) while avoiding any other changes to the image file.
Do note that there may be PII on the metadata and it will be copied
across untouched.  Some other tool can be used to inspect the
metadata.

Usage
-----

    jpegblur [xi,yi,width,height ...] < input.jpg > output.jpg

See the source code for a man page style documentation.

Build
-----

There is a `Makefile`.  With a single C++ file and dependency on
libjpeg and OpenCV, the build is relatively simple and no attempt has
been made to cover special cases.  Probably only works on Linux.
